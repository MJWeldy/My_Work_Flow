# Reproducible projects

Recent years have seen an explosion of tools available for use in academic and commecial applications. However, as the Peter Parker principle outlines, "with great power comes great responsibility." In general every scientist I've worked with does their best to operate other this principle. But, let's be honest, most of the readers of this guide are primarily ecologists, not computer scientists, or software engineers. We are in practice terrible hackers trying to tape together the tools we need to use in the best way we can.

The following guide is my attempt to share a workflow that I currently use. In full disclosure, none of this is original. I have put this together from a number of sources and have found it helps me stay organized, keeps my work portable (i.e. switching computers or passing code to coauthors does not cause a big headache), and helps track and archive changes throughout each project's lifetime. This guide will continue to evolve as I adapt different methods, and I welcome input from others along the way. 

For example:

  * @BES_guide_2017
  * @Earth_Lab
  * @RStudio_Git
  
All this begets the question, why worry about reproducibility and optimizing work flows? 

The short anwser is, do it for your future self. The long anwser is, well, long and mostly outside of this articles scope. Many articles, books, and blogposts have outlined the importance of reproducibility in science (see: ). There arguments point towards reliable and reproducible results, extension of local results to general theories, avoiding biased inferences, repdoducibility in peer review. These reasons are laudable and important. However, for your own sanity, picking an easy to manage reproducible workflow will slow the growth rate of your bald spot. Analyses typically take months and sometimes years to complete. Personally, I can hardly remember what I had for lunch yesterday, so it is important to me that I can open a research project, after nearly any length of time, and continue working. The goal of this workflow is to demonstrate a workflow that is insensitive to exploding computers, lost hard drives, sloppy collaborators, and prolonged peer reviews.

# Link Rstudio and Github

![This is what many of our folder directories look like. Source: "Piled Higher and Deeper" by Jorge Cham on www.phdcomics.com.](Images/final_doc.JPG){width=50%}

First things first. What is this Git thing I keep hearing about and how do I use it?

Using SSH keys
    
# Initialize a new project

# git ignore

# Working with a project



This is an RMarkdown document intended to outline my, in progress, solution to juggling project directory madness. Working through this document should outline the procedures I use to: 

1. Connect Rstudio to github
2. Initialize a new project
  + Including importing my project directory template
  + Daily workflow
  + Daily work documentation procedures


```{r fig.cap="figure caption"}
plot(1:12)
```

```{r tab.cap="table caption"}
head(iris)
```

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r fig.cap="figure caption", echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
